"        **Hooke potential** (elastic potential energy) can be used as a "
"simple model for the chemical bond. Its expression is:  \n"
"        \n"
"        $$V = \\frac{1}{2} k (r-r_e)^2$$  \n"
"        \n"
"        In this model the bond never breaks. It is a suitable model when "
"the energy are not very large.  \n"
"        \n"
"        **Morse potential** (anelastic potential energy) is a more "
"complex model for the chemical bond. Its expression is:  \n"
"        \n"
"        $$V = D_e \\left( \\left[1-e^{-\\alpha(r-r_e)} \\right)^2 -1 "
"\\right]$$  \n"
"        \n"
"        In this model there is a **dissociation limit**, an energy at "
"which the bond breaks. $D_e$ is the **potential well**, the deeper the "
"well, the higher the bond energy (i.e. the work needed to break the "
"bond).\n"
