"\n"
"    The **Ehrenfest model** is a simple representation of what happens "
"during the expansion of a perfect gas. In this applet you can choose how "
"many particles to put initially in box A and box B and how many steps of "
"the model to simulate. After that, you can create the simulation by "
"clicking on **generate** and observe what happens clicking on **play**. "
"The plot  on the right top shows the fraction of particles, $f$, in the "
"boxes ad each instant:  \n"
"    $$f_A = \\frac{N_A}{N}$$\n"
"    while the plot a the right bottom shows the probability distribution "
"of a **fluctuation**, at each instant. The fluctuation is the difference "
"of population between the boxes divided by the total number of particles "
"in the system:  \n"
"    \n"
"    $$fluct = \\frac{N_A- N_B}{N}$$\n"
