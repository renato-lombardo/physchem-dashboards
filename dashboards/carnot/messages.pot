"        **Carnot cycle** describes the thermodynamical behavior of the "
"**Carnot engine**.\n"
"        It consists of four steps, each performed in a reversible way.\n"
"        \n"
"        The total change of each state function ($U$, $S$, $p$, $V$, $T$)"
"  during a cycle is zero, being the initial and final point coincident. "
"However, the amounts of work and heat (that are path functions) are not "
"zero.\n"
"        \n"
"        The total amount of work, $w$, corresponds to the difference "
"bewteen the heat absorbed from the hot reservoir, $q_H$, and the heat "
"trasferred to the cold reservoir, $q_C$:\n"
"        \n"
"        $$w = q_H - q_C$$\n"
"        \n"
"        The efficiency of any engine, $\\eta$, is defined as:\n"
"        \n"
"        $$\\eta = \\frac{w}{q_H} = \\frac{q_H - q_C}{q_H}$$\n"
"        \n"
"        For a Carnot engine it is possible to derive that $\\eta$ is "
"also:\n"
"        \n"
"        $$\\eta = \\frac{T_H - T_C}{T_H} = 1 - \\frac{T_C}{T_H}$$\n"
