"        The **Hill-Langmuir equation** describes the interaction of a "
"ligand, $L$, with a binding site. Specifically, it relates the "
"**saturation**, $s$, to the ligand concentration.\n"
"\n"
"        $$s = \\frac{[L]^n}{([L]^n + K_d^n)}$$\n"
"\n"
"        where $[L]$ is the molar concentration of the ligand, $K_d$ is "
"the dissociation constant, and $n$ is the **Hill coefficient**, which "
"describes the cooperativity of the binding process.\n"
"\n"
"        The saturation corresponds to the ratio of occupied binding "
"sites, $N_L$, to the total number of binding sites, $N$:\n"
"\n"
"        $$ s = \\frac{N_L}{N}\n"
