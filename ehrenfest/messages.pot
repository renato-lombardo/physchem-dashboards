"        The **Ehrenfest model** is a simple representation of what "
"happens during the expansion of a perfect gas. In this applet you can "
"choose how many particles to put initially in box A and box B and how "
"many steps of the model to simulate. After that, you can create the "
"simulation by clicking on **generate** and observe what happens clicking "
"on **play**. The plots  on the right top shows the fraction of particles,"
" $f$, in the boxes ad each instant:  \n"
"        $$f_A = \\frac{N_A}{N}\n"
"        while the plot a the right bottom shows the probability "
"distribution of a **fluctuation**, at each instant. The fluctuation is "
"the difference of population between the boxes divided by the total "
"number of particles in the system:  \n"
"        \n"
"        $$fluct = \\frac{N_A- N_B}{N}$$\n"
